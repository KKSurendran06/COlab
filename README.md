# COlaba AI - Olabs Hackathon Project

## Inspiration Behind the Name
Colaba.AI was created as part of the Olabs hackathon to solve two fundamental issues:
1. **Collaboration** â€“ Enabling peer-to-peer learning and interaction.
2. **AI Integration** â€“ Leveraging AI to enhance the Olabs platform.

The name Colaba.AI reflects these core principles:

- **C** for Collaboration
- **Olabs** as the base platform
- **AI** for the artificial intelligence features
